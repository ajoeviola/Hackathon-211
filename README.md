# Hackathon-211

This program was made during a Hackathon our team participated in. The program itself serves as a basic covid-19 risk assesment that assesses an individual's risk of contracting covid-19, and stores the users data (age, risk level, name) in a dynamically allocated array that can fetched and output by the user. The user can assess multiple people without having to exit the program.

## Installation
The files contained should be opened in any C++ text editor such as Visual Studio and can be run through the console there.

###
Note: This program should not serve as a replacement for medical advice. It was not made by medical professionals and should not be used as such.
